             <h2>Test Design</h2>
             <p>The test consists of six types of questions, each covering a distinct portion of the overall construct (described above) and utilizing a distinct item type (see examples below). The test begins with brief general instructions, and each new section presents instructions and demonstrations for each new item type. Test takers respond to questions by selecting, dragging, or typing a response. All responses are scored as either correct or incorrect.</p>
`               <p>The total testing time is 30 minutes, and each question has a fixed response time that is shown with a timer. If the test taker does not respond to the question, the next question appears automatically at the end of the available time. In order to maximize the accuracy of each individualâ€™s score and placement decision, the test is adaptive. Test takers first complete an initial set of questions. Then, based on the accuracy of their responses, they are presented a second set of questions adapted to their likely proficiency range.</p>
